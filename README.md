Modern Mayhem is not a game for people looking to build pretty, pretty castles. This is war. Decisions have consequences. Use each building, troop, and alliance to determine your fate: conquer or be conquered . It is very strategic.

★★★★★
It’s time to get serious about mayhem. You’ve had the rest, time to try out the best. Start with a castle. Build an army. Join a guild. Go forth and conquer. It sounds simple, but play it wrong and it’s all gone. Empire building ain’t easy.
